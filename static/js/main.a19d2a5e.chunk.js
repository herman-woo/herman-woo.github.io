It took few revisions, but in the end I finished it. This was the first api/express server i was able to build completely from scratch, so it\'s really satisfying to get to see how they work under the hood. Thanks to having gone back to learn about promises, using async/await and try/catch, i felt pretty prepared to take this challenge on. So basically, this API allows users to take images and convert them to smaller images. The size and which file is determined by url parameters that are then read by the server. Currently all the images are local, i havent created a way to allow users to upload their own images and requests conversions from them. Everything uses the fs module from node, but hopefully after i finish this course i can come back, create a front end and try to host this app somewhere to showcase. But yea, in terms of progression, i can defiinitely sense it as i\'m just that much more confident handling data, whether objects or arrays, adn whether the data is local or from the internet through api calls. This was a great challenge, and overcoming it was incredibly satisfying"}]},{"id":"2021-06-00","date":"June 2021","events":[{"id":"2021-06-01","date":"Jun  1st","event":"Completed Object Oriented JavaScript Programming Assignmnet","reflection":"This Project wasnt too tough"},{"id":"2021-06-12","date":"Jun 12th","event":"Completed Functional Programming Assignmnet","reflection":"Now THIS was a fun project.
